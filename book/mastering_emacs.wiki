- Very funny that I'm typing in Vim about a book of Emacs.

- [X] 1. Introduction
- [ ] 2. The Way of Emacs
  - I like the way Emacs markdown-mode render the text. Of course, that can only done in the GUI version.
  - OK, so before Vim, there's Vi, before Vi there's Ed, and before Ed there's something I can remember.
  - Before Emacs, there's TECO.
  - Using Emacs require lots of keystrokes compare to Vim. Thus, I prefer the GUI version than using it within Tmux, which adds one more keystore for `C-b`.
