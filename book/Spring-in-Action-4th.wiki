    - [X] 1.1.2. Injecting dependencies
    - [X] 1.1.3. Applying aspects
      - ~Still don't figure out how to use AspectJ without XML.~
      - Now I know how. Add a `@PointCut` method and use it as the id for `@Before` and `@After`.

- [X] 2. Wiring beans
  - [X] 2.1. Exploring Spring's configuration options
  - [X] 2.2. Automatically wiring beans
    - Should lean on Automatic configuration.
    - [X] 2.2.1. Creating discoverable beans
      - Follow until listing 2.5, just some simple line of code, and we have DI unit test. Very nice.
    - [X] 2.2.2. Naming a component-scanned bean
      - `@Named` is not only a poor name, it also requires addtional dependency, so I would prefer `@Component`also.
    - [X] 2.2.3. Setting a base package for component scanning

  - [X] 3.3. Addressing ambiguity in autowiring
    - [X] 3.3.1. Designating a primary bean
    - [X] 3.3.2. Qualifying autowired beans
      - This isn't a fun thing to do. Too many conditions and that makes DI become useless.
  - [X] 3.4. Scoping beans
    - [X] 3.4.1. Working with request and session scope
      - Use `proxyMode` to work between beans that have different scope.

      - And in next session, they will take the handler to an external class.
